CrossyThree Multiplayer features various mini-games that players can enjoy together:

### Current Mini-Games

- **Tag**: Chase other players and try to tag them! The last player not tagged wins.
- **Floor is Lava**: Jump between safe platforms while the ground turns to lava. Last player standing wins.
- **Color Match**: Match your color with the displayed color by moving to the right zone. Score points for quick matches.

### Mini-Game Rules

- Mini-games take place in the same multiplayer environment
- Each game has simple rules that are displayed when the game starts
- Games are time-limited (usually 2-3 minutes)
- Players can vote on which mini-game to play next
- Scores are tracked and displayed at the end of each game

### Coming Soon

More mini-games are in development! Have an idea for a fun mini-game? Let us know through the feedback channels.
